Project 1: Tribute Page Ernest Hemingway

## to do


1. White space at the bottom of the page - bottom margin of the p element falls outside of the main styling for some reason
2. Can't figure out how to make a small spacing between the bottom of the image and the top of the caption
3. At some stage, use media queries to make the website responsive to different viewport sizes
4. Play with article margins. Break when shrinking window to smaller margins - is <article> the right element to apply styles too, or should I use a class?
5. Have I used viewpoint width correctly in the article style?
6. Why is figure displaying in the next paragraph?
7. does the min-width in .paragraph-figure-right/left conflict with the width: 40%? Is this the right way of doing it? Will is case any issues?
