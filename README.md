Project 1: Tribute Page Ernest Hemingway

## to do

- [x] White space at the bottom of the page - bottom margin of the p element falls outside of the main styling for some reason
- [ ] Can't figure out how to make a small spacing between the bottom of the image and the top of the caption
- [ ] At some stage, use media queries to make the website responsive to different viewport sizes
- [ ] Play with article margins. Break when shrinking window to smaller margins - is <article> the right element to apply styles too, or should I use a class?
- [ ] Have I used viewpoint width correctly in the article style?
- [ ] Why is figure displaying in the next paragraph?
- [ ] does the min-width in .paragraph-figure-right/left conflict with the width: 40%? Is this the right way of doing it? Will is case any issues?
